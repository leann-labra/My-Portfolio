# My-Portfolio
Challenge 2 Advanced CSS, this project is designed to challenge and apply the concepts I learned from our CSS section in class. This website acts doubly as a way for me to also build a portfolio for myself that I will add onto as my skills progress through this bootcamp course.

## Project Description
 In this project, I tried my best to implement advanced CSS techniques such as flex-box, pseudo selectorsm and attempted to improve my html semantics structure. Although I'm not super happy with the way this project turned out at the the time of submission, this has given me an opportunity to look into what more I can improve. The challenges I faced with creating code from scratched was keeping organized, and having a clear idea of how I wanted to structure my webpage. If I could do it over again, I would've broken down my project into smaller blocked pieces to avoid discouragement. This has been a good lesson on how to time block problems, and motivates me to improve on project management despite my busy schedule. At least for now I can feel satisfied in knowing that I did the best I could with the skills I curently have. Ultimately, this projects incompletion has given me good insight on wehere I can improve.
